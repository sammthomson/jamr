JAMR - AMR Parser
=================

JAMR is a semantic parser for the [Abstract Meaning Representation](http://amr.isi.edu/).


Building
========

JAMR depends on

 * [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org),
 * the [Illinois NER system](http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/download_view/NETagger) (should also work with newer versions),
 * the tokenization scripts in [cdec](https://github.com/redpony/cdec) (does not require compiling cdec),
 * [WordNet](http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/3.0/WordNet-3.0.tar.gz) (for the aligner).


Install these dependencies, and then change the relevant environment variables in
`scripts/config.sh`.
Source the config script so that other bash scripts have access to these environment variables (or 
add them to ~/.bashrc to set them permanently):

    . scripts/config.sh

Run `./compile` to build an uberjar, which will be output to
    `target/scala-{scala_version}/jamr-assembly-{jamr_version}.jar`
(If you get out of memory errors during this step, you may need to edit the Java memory options
in the script `sbt` and `build.sbt`.)

Preprocessing
=============

Download `LDC2013E117.tgz` from the LDC Catalog (requires an LDC subscription).
Extract the file `deft-amr-release-r3-proxy.txt` into `data/LDC-2013-Sep/` and rename it
`amr-release-proxy.txt`.

    cd scripts/preprocessing

Run `./PREPROCESS.sh`.


Training
========

(To skip this step, download and extract model weights [current.tgz](http://cs.cmu.edu/~jmflanig/current.tgz) 
into the directory experiments/current.)

    cd scripts/training

Extract concept table:

    ./cmd.conceptTable.train

Concept identification (stage1) training:

    ./cmd.stage1-weights

Relation identification (stage2) training:

    ./cmd.stage2-weights

(Search for 'Performance on Dev' in `stage2-weights.err` for early stopping)


Evaluating
==========

Decode test set:

    ./cmd.test.decode.allstages

  or

    ./cmd.test.decode.stage2only

Evaluate the predictions using smatch:

    ${JAMR_HOME}/scripts/smatch_v1_0/smatch_modified.py --pr -f ${JAMR_HOME}/experiments/current/test.decode.allstages ${JAMR_HOME}/data/LDC-2013-Sep/amr-release-proxy.test
    ${JAMR_HOME}/scripts/smatch_v1_0/smatch_modified.py --pr -f ${JAMR_HOME}/experiments/current/test.decode.stage2only ${JAMR_HOME}/data/LDC-2013-Sep/amr-release-proxy.test
